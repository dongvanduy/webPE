    <description>Aspose.Slides for .NET is a comprehensive on-premise API that seamlessly integrates into your .NET applications and enhances their capabilities to make them work with Microsoft PowerPoint® and OpenDocument presentation file formats (PPT, PPTX, POT, POTX, PPS, PPSX, ODP, OTP, etc.). 
Without having to install a PowerPoint program or any 3rd party component, you can use Aspose.Slides to build different types of .NET applications, e.g., Windows Forms Apps, Windows Web Apps, as well as to deploy Web Services. For example, Aspose, using its own APIs, developed a free web application (https://products.aspose.app/slides/conversion/ppt-to-word) that allows people to convert their PPT files to Word online.

Aspose.Slides for .NET can be used to create, edit, format, merge, split, save, render, print, and convert presentations. It can be used to work with presentation slides, content, design, security, properties, comments, notes, animations, and VBA macros. You can also work with the 3D aspects of PowerPoint presentations (rotation, depth, extrusion, gradient, WordArt). You can accurately convert your presentation files to numerous popular file formats, such as PDF, XPS, TIFF, HTML, etc.

With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can implement many complicated scenarios for managing tons of presentations. You get to merge and split presentations, clone and compare slides, work with multiple slide masters and layouts, modify presentation viewer and password-protection properties. You can manage tables, math equations, BLOBs, MSO charts, SmartArts, animations, audio/video frames, OLE objects, slides notes, and comments.

Aspose.Slides for .NET supports operations with Microsoft PowerPoint (97 to 2019), MS PowerPoint for Mac, and Office 365. It can be used on any 32-bit or 64-bit OS, where .NET Framework, .NET Core, or Mono framework is available: MS Windows Desktop and Server editions, popular flavors of Linux, macOS X. COM Interop Support (COM, C++, VB.NET) is also available. Aspose.Slides for .NET can also be used on Azure and AWS.</description>
